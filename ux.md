* use one color sharpie for drawing init sketch as we tend to focus on
  details (like color, line thicknes) when we should really focus on
  functionality details [1]
* when client comes and wants an app but have no idea what that app
  should do, sit him with designers, developers, domain owners (people
  who know about the problem most) to groups of 3-4 people. Give each 
  group pencils, creyons, sharpies, stickers papers scissors and Let
  each  group drow their own ideas independantly, then compare ideas.
  (sit developer, designer, domain owner, client, ... mix them up)
  this session should not took more then 4h [2]
* if a client has no idea what he wants tell them to imagine if they had 
  limitlesss money limitless time what that app would do (GPS, video,..)
  and then gradually throw away stuff that's not necesary [2]
