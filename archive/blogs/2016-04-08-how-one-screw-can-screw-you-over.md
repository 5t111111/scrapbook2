# How one screw can screw you over

The other day I've decided that I want to buy bigger hard disk for my
old [EEE PC laptop](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Eee_PC_1005HA_Seashell/).
Laptop is single core Atom not really powerful but I really love it and use it
as private home server for stuff like photos, documents, trying out
silly personal [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) projects.

Over the years I've replaced numerouse hardware parts in numerouse
computers and specialy this one. The task of replacing hard disk became
really trivial to me and over the years I grown to be recless to the
hardware.
