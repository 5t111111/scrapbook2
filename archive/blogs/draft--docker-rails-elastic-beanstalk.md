### Preparing docker

* install Docker
* install docker-composer

### Development mode

First of all clone our dummy project 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:equivalent/docker_rails_aws_eb_demmo_app.git
cd ./docker_rails_aws_eb_demmo_app
```

Now open the `./docker-compose.yml`. Now for those new to Docker this
may be huge W.T.H. moment, but trust me it's easier than it looks.
