# Moores Law and simple solution


There are two components when we talk about computers limitation: Hardware and
Software. Hardware being the computing processors,  memory, disk space, and so on
And then there is Software. These are programs we are executing. You know our
Microsoft Excel, Minecraft or everyone's favorit Tax software.

You see the reason why Moore's law is a big deal is because most of our
software can run only on one processor core.

But at this point of human civilization you can have and you probably already own multiple multi core
processor device. Latest smartphones like iPhone or Google Pixel have like 4 to 8
cores, modern laptops have 2 or 4 cores, some graphic cards have like 512 cores,
even most popular Intel chips i3, i5, i7 chips have 2
physical cores. Well Intel is branding them as chips that can do
"Hyperthread" to 4 cores but in reality they have 2 physical cores that
can act as extra virtual cores. It's a hack that I'll talk about later.


You often hear software developers say "we cannot scale horizontally but we can scale
vertically" that means we cannot buy a bigger server but lets buy more
smaller servers, or in this case we cannot put more power to single core but we
can have more cores.

The problem is that lot of programming and software development history was
about taking advantage of a single core. That's why most modern software is
still written this way (e.g. Microsoft Excel still running on single core).
To get things even worse, upon that existing
 software developers are stacking more single core software.

That's why we are stuck in this Moors law nightmare.

But if the software was
written "concurrently"  then you have no problem to use multiple cores.

So what does "concurrently" mean ?

Imagine you have a shuffled deck of cards, and it's only you who can
sort them in order. Cool you are single core processor.

Now imagine you
have 3 friends over (so 4 of you) and you will give to each 25% of the
deck cards  to sort out and then you will just join them together.
Awesome Now you are 4 core processor running program concurrently

Now imagine same
situation where you don't want your 3 friends to touch the cards so  you
will sort them together while your buddies are watching TV. Now you are
4 core processor running program on single core (e.g. most of the world
software)

So why aren't software developers writing programs this way ? Well some
has to do with the fact that there was never too much pressure to
develop differently. First two core processor was introduced in 2005
with plenty of power for single core. Now in 2017 we are facing the
reality that sigle core is not enough. It's like running on petrol
engine till last drop of oil is spent and wondering why everyone didn't
switch to electric cars earlier. 

Another factor is Education both in computer classes and around the
internet. Lot of existing well respected programming
materials are still describing how to work with single core only.

But the biggest factor is productivity. You see lot of existing
programming languages predicted this outcome and included a way how to
deal with processing on multiple cores. But the problem was that it
would add extra complexicity that would make software development
slower. That's why lot of companies sacrificed potentional future
eficiencity with imidiet productivity. 

But you cannot really blame them as it's natural selection in practice.
We choose the software with more features at better price, not the more
expensive software with less features that will work better in 5 years.

But the future is bright my friends.

Last couple of years there is huge mindset shifting in Software
Developer communities and pressure emphasis on concurrent programming.
Programmers are rediscovering old paradigms that are better dealing with
concurrency.


For those more technical folks: Functional programming is raising in popularity.
New laguages like Elixir, Go & Clojure  same as older Erlang, Haskal are
enjoying huge comeback.
Functional programming languages are awesome because they can achieve
communication between multiple cores really easily.

Yes I know I know Object oriented  languages
like  Java, Ruby,... can do concurrent programming as well but there is
"thread" level locking of state that is to some degree working but would
never reach 100% potential of all cores)


 So the only limitation at this
point are (unfortunately) people and cost of rewriting popular software
concurrently. Conclusion  although protein chips sound cool the truth is
that for next decade silicone chips are here to stay. It's just you will
have 128 core laptop. The Quantum computer is definitely the future but
at this point way ahead of it's time.ï»¿

some servers have 64 core
