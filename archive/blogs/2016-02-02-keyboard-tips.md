# Ergonomic and faster typing practices for Web Developers


As with any craft there comes a natural need to improve our skills in
Web Development methods. We teach ourself new coding patterns, we try
new development tools, new 

Brains are the engine of web-developer and the fingers are the wheels.
So far there is no better way how to express Web Developers intentions
than typing the code on or keyboards to our editors.




## Typing with Ten Finger Typing Technique

With  Ten Finger Typing Technique  typists are using all fingers to
type. With left pinky on a QWERTY keyboard you type `1, q, a, z`, Left
ring finger `2, w, s, x`, and so on.

!['Ten Finger Typing - hand positions'][101]

When developers type with ten finger technique, we are using the full
potential of our hands and fingers to type.

We:

* move our hand only up and down not side to side - less effort for
  fingers
* type faster
* type without looking on a keyboard
* keep our eyes on a text entire time
* less mistakes, less deleting
* more productive editor shortcut execution

When developers type with freestyle typing technique
they are loosing all the above benefits.

One of the biggest arguments against typing with Ten Finger Technique is
that programmers and web-developers too often use special chars like
`{}"'/?\~ <>` usually located on the right side of the keyboard, and
therefore the right small finger (pinky) gets to tired (image above, yellow section).

Well, this is true, however the problem isn't that the typing technique is bad,
the problem is that QWERTY keyboard layout we  designed for
different group of people (writers, newspaper editors, ...)

## Dvorak

The [QWERTY][18] layout was designed not for
speed and productivity, but so that the mechanical typewriter won't jam.

Between 1914-1932 Dr August Dvorak and Wiliam Dealey designed new layout of
keyboard designed for speed and less errors in typing called [Dvorak
Simplifiex Keyboard Layout][5]. In experiments done on typists it was discovered that Dvorak
layout was + 1/3 more effective in speed than QWERTY.

> [source][6]

![Dvorak keyboard layout][102]

With your left hand typist type the vowels while his right hand is typing mostly used consonants.

Now this design choice brought very
interesting side-effect for web-developers. Some of the special chars (`"'<,>.`) were moved
to the left hand side of the layout. This doesn't solve the right-hand
little finger problem entirely but definitely helps a lot.

There is also a [Programmer Dvorak][7] which suppose to be designed to
even more improve productivity of typing for programmers / software developers
however I'm not recommending it as it's maybe way too different. I've
tried it for a week was not suitable for me, maybe it well be for you.

Usually the question I get from people is: "But where would I buy a
MacBook with Dvorak?". Well, simply you don't have to. If you use 10
finger technique you don't need to see the keys, your brain knows where
the keys are. Sure, you can buy a mechanical keyboard and reposition the key,
but that's noth the point. The layout is in your head.

Once again Dvorak is only effective if you are going to use 10 finger
technique. If you are a designer where you do need one hand on the mouse
all the time and you use left hand just for shortcuts,
the Dvorak would not be the best idea in my opinion.

### Pair coding argument against Dvorak

One argument against Dvorak I get a lot is that: 

`"For pair coding I want to use same layout as my colegues"`

Well yes that's a valid argument, however the question is what layout we
are talking about? If QWERTY are we talking about `US` or `GB` version
of QWERTY ? (I work in London UK).

Here is a photo  of a Belgium keyboard MacBook of my friend / colleague:


!['Ten Finger Typing - hand positions'][101]

For me argument that "everyone should use EN QWERTY" in a multicultural
City is more than nonsense.

Now days there are better ways how to pair-code, like using CloudIDE or
SSHing to a common VM or use [tmux][19]



## Split Keyboards

I'm a tall dude with wide shoulders. When I'm typing on a keyboard it
feels like all keyboards in the world wer design for much smaller
people. Usually after few hours of working on keyboard my wrists get
into pain. This happens even with more expensive keyboards like Mac has.

The pain comes from a hand possition like this

![image of hands]

There is a chance you've seen some people using ergonomic keyboards
where the layout is split in half and curved on one monolyth board.

![image of ergomonmic keyboard]

Ergonomic keyboard are improvement but not enough, plus they are usually
really rubust and large so they are not good for traveling.

I prefere split keyboards where layout is phisicly split to two boards,
therefore user can positioned them anyway it's confortable for them.


![image of split keyboard]

Split keyboards are awesome and good to travel with. Problem is that
they are expensive (cheapest around $100). Solution I use and recommend is
just to order two regular travel keyboards and use a USB hub to connect them. I went even further and I've cut of USB cables and [solder][3] them to USB hub
cables. This way I've end up with $35 Split keyboard that I can use for
pair coding on one computer if needed.

## Vim

When I decided to learn Ten Finger Technique, I was starting to learn
basics of [Vim][1] editor. As if this combination was not hard enough I
thought to myself, hmm how about I teach myself Dvorak too. The
transition was really hard, and for period of 2 weeks I had headaches,
but it was worth it.

Dvorak and Ten Finger Typing Technique comes naturally  together and
Vim is awesome addition to this symphony. Vim is tremendres when it
comes to keyboard shortcuts limiting usage of Right Hand Pinky to
minimum. Lot of people will refernec Vim to a dinosaur and reliqe that
only "wierd old Linux Hippies use" but they never used Vim them self, or
if they did they didn't try any extension.

My encorigement is to try Vim for a week, but not with just basics. Lern
split screens, visual selection,  read some tutorials watch some screencats,
 if you ar a Ruby person install [Janus Vim][12] (collection of cool lib
that will make your Vim proper IDE)

* [vim][10]
* [vim][11]

But realliy if  you decide you want to use  [Emacs][8]
 or [Sublime][9] edittor it doesn't really matter, just make sure you
discover all the potentianal cool shortcuts that will ease your life,
only that way you will truly benefit Dvorak and Ten Finger Typing
Technique.

## All about keeping your eyes on the screen

The true key towards productivity is to do everything in order to keep
your eyes on the screen. Think about it. When you are typing with  2 / 3
fingers you need to look from time to time on the keyboard whether you are hitting the
correct keys. The time to locate the position of the line is quick, but
still it's extra uncesarry work for your eyes and brain that's adds up
by end of the day.

Lot of time I see people worknig on two or three monitors where on one
screen they have console on other logs on other browser, ... I was using
similar setup year or two myself and the biggest problem I found in it
was that in order to switch context I needed to actually **turn my
head**.

Now this sounds really stupid but think about it. In order to switch
from console to logs you need to turn your head then use your eyes to
find the line and then start processing the information. When you want
to go back to console you need to turn your head, adjust eyes,  find
information, and so on..., There is unecesary element of mechanical neck
movement.

Now two /three monitors may be awesome or even necesary for designers working in
Photoshop or 3Ds Max. My girlfriend is a 3D modeler and from countless
weekends I was watching her working in her enviroment and how everything
has it's place. more bigger  screen she has the more productive she is.

But web developers spend most of time solving issues in text editors
We don't have to have different tabs for special tools.

> Few honorable exception I found over the years where it make sence to

>
> * if develpors do  UX design or, Photoshop mockups allong code
> * full IDEs like Eclipse, RubyMine, Netbeans, ...
> * if you write Cucumber tests (Gerkin lang) in one screen and step definitions in other
>   screen

We usually fallow programming conventions (like [ruby style guide][13])
that guides us to use 80 or so chars per line as a limit, so that our
code is readable to all our collegues and on Github.

In my opinion external screens when used as the only screen are not needed as well.
I like to use them whenever possible as larger text means less struggle for the eyes
but there is a sort of elegance in writing text on a smaller screen. You
will be pusshed to focuse on one thing, you will be pusshed to close
any background  appplications that are not necesary needed for the
current task. Another point is that you will get use to same screen as
you have when you code in sofa, train, or coffee shop.
If you are a person who codes only on office table none of the points I
made in this paragraph may not be relevant for you.

It's really up to you to try out what works for you and figure these for
your self.

But if we don't use two screens how can we be sill productive ?

## Workspaces

Workspaces (or sometime refernced as "Desktops") are your visual
enviromne........

In sort of extension we all are familiar with `Alt+Tab` combination
(switch to other application). Now imagine you need for your work
WebBrowser where you run the web application you are developing, Rails
console to debug, another console where you run test and text editor.
That is 4 applications that means on one workspace that means pressing
up to 4 times `Alt+Tab` combination

Now imagine a boss ask's you to `ssh` to server and to reply to
important email. That's extra 2. Some of us would be tempted just to
close some of the applications we not necesserally need in order to
complete the task, but let's be realistic, you were working on this
piece of code since morning, you don't want to reopen all the editor
tabs, and in Rails console you are in middle of writing a object on the
fly. Therefore you chose to open 2 more apps and than just deal with 6
`Alt+tabs` 

All of us experienced how this go out of hand.

Now imagine that we will add extra workspace where we would keep the
stuff we were working on, and we would do the stuff that boss asked us.

Now this is more productive. But this goes out of control really easy
and soon we loose track of what is on what workspace. That is the main
point that OperatingSystems removed workspaces from default setup, as
users were complaining that they cannot find their applications.

Now Imagine you will not use 2 workspaces but you would use 6 (3 columns
in 2 rows). Now imagine you will make a contract with yourself that you
will have ideally 2, max 3 windows and on particilar workspaces you will
have only certain usage scope of applications. For example

* workspace 1: Browser with `localhost:3000`, and Rails server / log
* workspace 2: Editor, Rails console, console to run tests
* workspace 3: Comunication tools with your collegues (Slack, email
               client, browser with work Gmail,...)
* workspace 4: ssh connection to app server
* workspace 5: personal stuff, music, personal Gmail, ..
* workspace 6: everything else

Now in every workspace you will press ideally 2, max 3 times `Alt+Tab`
to get your stuff done.

Key here is not to think about the work spaces in numbers, but imagine
them in space; table of 3 cols in 2 rows.

    |  workspace 1  |  workspace 2 | workspace 3 |
    |  workspace 4  |  workspace 5 | workspace 6 |

Therefore you don't think about `"I need to test my localhost in
workspace 1 and turn of music in Workspace 5"` but you imagine `"I have my localhost browser in top-left"`

In terms of switching between workspaces you
will configure keybord shortcuts that would be easily accessable.
Because the previous section was about Ten Finger Typing Technique we
will assume you are typing with 10 fingers. 
Best accessible numbers for 10 finger technique are 1,2 3, 0, 9, 8 as
they are easily reachable, therefore we will configure this shortcuts:

* workspace 1: `ctrl + 1`
* workspace 2: `ctrl + 2`
* workspace 3: `ctrl + 3`
* workspace 4: `ctrl + 8`
* workspace 5: `ctrl + 9`
* workspace 6: `ctrl + 0`



in ubuntu go to `Apperance` click tab `Behavior` and click checkbox
`enable workspaces`
