I'm a tall dude with wide shoulders. When I'm typing on a keyboard it
feels like all keyboards in the world wer design for much smaller
people. Usually after few hours of working on keyboard my wrists get
into pain. This happens even with more expensive keyboards like Mac has.

The pain comes from a hand possition like this

There is a chance you've seen some people using ergonomic keyboards
where the layout is split in half and curved on one monolyth board.

Ergonomic keyboard are improvement but not enough, plus they are usually
really rubust and large so they are not good for traveling.

I prefere split keyboards where layout is phisicly split to two boards,
therefore user can positioned them anyway it's confortable for them.

Split keyboards are awesome and good to travel with. Problem is that
they are expensive (cheapest around $100). Solution I use and recommend is
just to order two regular travel keyboards and use a USB hub to connect them. I went even further and I've cut of USB cables and [solder][3] them to USB hub
cables. This way I've end up with $35 Split keyboard that I can use for
pair coding on one comupter if needed.
