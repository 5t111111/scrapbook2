# Web Developers Life Hacks

When it comes to multitasking often the role of web-developer is put to
the limit, specially when you are Full Stack developer in startup
environment or a smaller team company where is counter productive to
specialize. We are often asked to work on back-end, front-end, roll deployments run
tests do code reviews, and answer to important email at the same time.

There has been lot of [research][4] done on how humans do multitasking and basically
we don't. Our brain can really do only one thing effective. Yes we can
listen music and still do Math, but we cannot teach ourself Math and
Spanish at the same time.

That's why I like adjust my work environment in a way that helps my
brain do least amount of work to switch between multiple tasks.


## Typing with Ten Finger Typing Technique

In ten Ten Finger Typing Technique a person is using all fingers to
type. With left pinky on a QWERTY keyboard you type `1, q, a, z`, Left
ring finger `2, w, s, x`, and so on. 

When developers type with ten finger technique, we are using the full
potential of our hands and fingers to type.

We:

* type faster
* move our hand only up and down not side to side
* type without looking on a keyboard
* keep our eyes on a text entire time
* less mistakes, less deleting

When developers type with 2 or 3 finger they are loosing all the
above benefits.

One of the biggest arguments against typing with Ten Finger Technique is
that programmers and web-developers to often use special chars like
`{}"'/?\~ <>` usually located on the right side of the keyboard, and
therefore the right pinky gets to tired. Well, this is true, however the
problem isn't that the technique is bad, the problem is that the of
keyboard layout we use was designed for different group of people
(writers, newspaper editors, ...)


## Dvorak

The QWERTY layout that is mostly used in western culture was designed
for typewriters. The problem is that the layout was designed not for
speed and productivity, but so that the typewriter wont jam. 

In 1918 Dr August Dvorak and Wiliam Dealey designed new layout of
keyboard designed for speed and less error in typing called [Dvorak
keyboard][5]. In experiments done on typists it was discovered that Dvorak
layout was 1/3 more effective in speed

> Contest typing competition QWERTY typists were complaining that they

With your left hand you hold all the vowels
on the master line (which you type most of the time as they are in all
the words). You use your right hand for the mostly used consonants,
therefore your left hand is on the master line most of the time and only
right hand is moving up and down. 

As you can see the Dvorak keyboard is much more friendly for
programers/developers as you have `"'<,>.` on the line above left hand
master line and therefore you don't use your right pinky that often.

There is also a [Programmer Dvorak][7] which suppose to be designed to
even more improve productivity of typing for programmers / software developers
however I'm not recommending it as it's maybe way too different. I've
tried it for a week was not suitable for me, maybe it well be for you.

Usually the question I get from people is: "But where would I buy a
MacBook with Dvorak?". Well simply you don't have to. If you use 10
finger technique you don't need to see the keys, your brain knows where
the keys are. Sure, you can buy a mechanical keyboard and reposition the key,
but that's noth the point. The layout is in your head.

Once again Dvorak is only effective if you are going to use 10 finger
technique. If you are a designer where you do need one hand on the mouse
all the time and you use left hand just for shortcuts,
the Dvorak would not be the best idea in my opinion.

## Split Keyboards

I'm a tall dude with wide shoulders. When I'm typing on a keyboard it
feels like all keyboards in the world wer design for much smaller
people. Usually after few hours of working on keyboard my wrists get
into pain. This happens even with more expensive keyboards like Mac has.

The pain comes from a hand possition like this

There is a chance you've seen some people using ergonomic keyboards
where the layout is split in half and curved on one monolyth board.

Ergonomic keyboard are improvement but not enough, plus they are usually
really rubust and large so they are not good for traveling.

I prefere split keyboards where layout is phisicly split to two boards,
therefore user can positioned them anyway it's confortable for them.

Split keyboards are awesome and good to travel with. Problem is that
they are expensive (cheapest around $100). Solution I use and recommend is
just to order two regular travel keyboards and use a USB hub to connect them. I went even further and I've cut of USB cables and [solder][3] them to USB hub
cables. This way I've end up with $35 Split keyboard that I can use for
pair coding on one computer if needed.
