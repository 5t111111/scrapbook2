# Web Developers Life Hacks

When it comes to multitasking often the role of web-developer is put to
the limit, specially when you are Full Stack developer in startup
environment or a smaller team company where is counter productive to
specialize. We are often asked to work on back-end, front-end, roll deployments run
tests do code reviews, and answer to important email at the same time.

There has been lot of [research][4] done on how humans do multitasking and basically
we don't. Our brain can really do only one thing effective. Yes we can
listen music and still do Math, but we cannot teach ourself Math and
Spanish at the same time.

That's why I like adjust my work environment in a way that helps my
brain do least amount of work to switch between multiple tasks.


## Typing with Ten Finger Typing Technique

In ten Ten Finger Typing Technique a person is using all fingers to
type. With left pinky on a QWERTY keyboard you type `1, q, a, z`, Left
ring finger `2, w, s, x`, and so on. 

When developers type with ten finger technique, we are using the full
potential of our hands and fingers to type.

We:

* type faster
* move our hand only up and down not side to side
* type without looking on a keyboard
* keep our eyes on a text entire time
* less mistakes, less deleting

When developers type with 2 or 3 finger they are loosing all the
above benefits.

One of the biggest arguments against typing with Ten Finger Technique is
that programmers and web-developers to often use special chars like
`{}"'/?\~ <>` usually located on the right side of the keyboard, and
therefore the right pinky gets to tired. Well, this is true, however the
problem isn't that the technique is bad, the problem is that the of
keyboard layout we use was designed for different group of people
(writers, newspaper editors, ...)


## Dvorak

The QWERTY layout that is mostly used in western culture was designed
for typewriters. The problem is that the layout was designed not for
speed and productivity, but so that the typewriter wont jam. 

In 1918 Dr August Dvorak and Wiliam Dealey designed new layout of
keyboard designed for speed and less error in typing called [Dvorak
keyboard][5]. In experiments done on typists it was discovered that Dvorak
layout was 1/3 more effective in speed

![dvorak keyboard] 

With your left hand you hold all the vowels
on the master line (which you type most of the time as they are in all
the words). You use your right hand for the mostly used consonants,
therefore your left hand is on the master line most of the time and only
right hand is moving up and down. 

As you can see the Dvorak keyboard is much more friendly for
programers/developers as you have `"'<,>.` on the line above left hand
master line and therefore you don't use your right pinky that often.

There is also a [Programmer Dvorak][7] which suppose to be designed to
even more improve productivity of typing for programmers / software developers
however I'm not recommending it as it's maybe way too different. I've
tried it for a week was not suitable for me, maybe it well be for you.

Usually the question I get from people is: "But where would I buy a
MacBook with Dvorak?". Well simply you don't have to. If you use 10
finger technique you don't need to see the keys, your brain knows where
the keys are. Sure, you can buy a mechanical keyboard and reposition the key,
but that's noth the point. The layout is in your head.

Once again Dvorak is only effective if you are going to use 10 finger
technique. If you are a designer where you do need one hand on the mouse
all the time and you use left hand just for shortcuts,
the Dvorak would not be the best idea in my opinion.

## Split Keyboards

> [Watch my full video on split keyboards](https://youtu.be/sDQ8-LmWbow) on
> YouTube (script can be found [here][2]

I'm a tall dude with wide shoulders. When I'm typing on a keyboard it
feels like all keyboards in the world wer design for much smaller
people. Usually after few hours of working on keyboard my wrists get
into pain. This happens even with more expensive keyboards like Mac has.

The pain comes from a hand possition like this

![image of hands]

There is a chance you've seen some people using ergonomic keyboards
where the layout is split in half and curved on one monolyth board.

![image of ergomonmic keyboard]

Ergonomic keyboard are improvement but not enough, plus they are usually
really rubust and large so they are not good for traveling.

I prefere split keyboards where layout is phisicly split to two boards,
therefore user can positioned them anyway it's confortable for them.


![image of split keyboard]

Split keyboards are awesome and good to travel with. Problem is that
they are expensive (cheapest around $100). Solution I use and recommend is
just to order two regular travel keyboards and use a USB hub to connect them. I went even further and I've cut of USB cables and [solder][3] them to USB hub
cables. This way I've end up with $35 Split keyboard that I can use for
pair coding on one computer if needed.

## Vim

When I decided to learn Ten Finger Technique, I was starting to learn
basics of [Vim][1] editor. As if this combination was not hard enough I
thought to myself, hmm how about I teach myself Dvorak too. The
transition was really hard, and for period of 2 weeks I had headaches,
but it was worth it.

Dvorak and Ten Finger Typing Technique comes naturally  together and
Vim is awesome addition to this symphony. Vim is tremendres when it
comes to keyboard shortcuts limiting usage of Right Hand Pinky to
minimum. Lot of people will refernec Vim to a dinosaur and reliqe that
only "wierd old Linux Hippies use" but they never used Vim them self, or
if they did they didn't try any extension.

My encorigement is to try Vim for a week, but not with just basics. Lern
split screens, visual selection,  read some tutorials watch some screencats,
 if you ar a Ruby person install [Janus Vim][12] (collection of cool lib
that will make your Vim proper IDE)

* [vim][10]
* [vim][11]

But realliy if  you decide you want to use  [Emacs][8]
 or [Sublime][9] edittor it doesn't really matter, just make sure you
discover all the potentianal cool shortcuts that will ease your life,
only that way you will truly benefit Dvorak and Ten Finger Typing
Technique.

## All about keeping your eyes on the screen

The true key towards productivity is to do everything in order to keep
your eyes on the screen. Think about it. When you are typing with  2 / 3
fingers you need to look from time to time on the keyboard whether you are hitting the
correct keys. The time to locate the position of the line is quick, but
still it's extra uncesarry work for your eyes and brain that's adds up
by end of the day.

Lot of time I see people worknig on two or three monitors where on one
screen they have console on other logs on other browser, ... I was using
similar setup year or two myself and the biggest problem I found in it
was that in order to switch context I needed to actually **turn my
head**.

Now this sounds really stupid but think about it. In order to switch
from console to logs you need to turn your head then use your eyes to
find the line and then start processing the information. When you want
to go back to console you need to turn your head, adjust eyes,  find
information, and so on..., There is unecesary element of mechanical neck
movement.

Now two /three monitors may be awesome or even necesary for designers working in
Photoshop or 3Ds Max. My girlfriend is a 3D modeler and from countless
weekends I was watching her working in her enviroment and how everything
has it's place. more bigger  screen she has the more productive she is.

But web developers spend most of time solving issues in text editors
We don't have to have different tabs for special tools.

> Few honorable exception I found over the years where it make sence to

> * full IDEs like Eclipse, RubyMine, Netbeans, ...

>   screen

We usually fallow programming conventions (like [ruby style guide][13])
that guides us to use 80 or so chars per line as a limit, so that our
code is readable to all our collegues and on Github.

In my opinion external screens when used as the only screen are not needed as well.
I like to use them whenever possible as larger text means less struggle for the eyes
but there is a sort of elegance in writing text on a smaller screen. You
will be pusshed to focuse on one thing, you will be pusshed to close
any background  appplications that are not necesary needed for the
current task. Another point is that you will get use to same screen as
you have when you code in sofa, train, or coffee shop.
If you are a person who codes only on office table none of the points I
made in this paragraph may not be relevant for you.

It's really up to you to try out what works for you and figure these for
your self.

But if we don't use two screens how can we be sill productive ?
