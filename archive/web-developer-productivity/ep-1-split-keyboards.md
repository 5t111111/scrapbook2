Today I want to talk about split keyboards, reasons why I use them and why I think
anyone who is typing with 10 finger technique should use them, specially if you are
a person with wide shoulders or tall person like me (I'm nearly 2m tall, that's like 6.5 (feet))

Here is a typical "laptop size" travel keyboard that could be compared to any notebook / macbook.
When I'm writing my hands get to this really creepy position.
That is not good.

Whether you are editor writing a long text or a software-developer writing a code, 
this is not a good position to be for 8 hours.

I personally feel wrist pain after 3 - 4 hours holding hands like this,
even if I take regular breaks after 30 minutes.
(Pomodoro technique which I'll explain in some other episode).

Ideally when working on keyboard your hands should be parallel to your shoulder. 

Lot of keyboard brands introduced ergonomic keyboards where the keyboard
layout is split in half on a curved monolithic board. Yes truth is they
are better solution than regular keyborads but still not enough for tall
people. Another problem is that the good ones are overpriced and too big
/ heavy to travel.

Much better way to achive this is to buy "split keyboard", where layout is split in literal half
(meaning 2 bords conected via cable). Therefore you can turn them,
position them the way that is the best for your shoulders and not relly
on manufacturers limited setup.

Split keyboards are awesome but kind of pricy (last time I googled the
cheapest one was like $100)

I'm not paying that money for a keyboard.

Here is solution that I use:

I have two $10 small travel keyboards plugged to a $5 usb hub where I use half of the layout for
left hand and other half for right hand. It's the same dynamic setup
solution like split-keyboard provides

You can go even further with this and cut of the keyboard cables, cut of
the USB hub cables solder them together and you have literal split
keyboard.


Here is a example of me playing "typeracer".

I ended up at 52 w.p.m. My average is around 50. (I'm not that fast)


I'm using this 2keyboard split for over 4 year now. I'm much more
productive.
You save money you save your wrists and you have extra keyboar whenever
you need to pair-code with someone :)
