Hello my name is Tomas, I work at EdTech startup Pobble, I'm a
Ruby  full-stack web-developer and today I want to talk about some
life-hacks and non-software related techniques I use in daily base
that can improve your programmer life too.

As this beeing a lightning talk I'll skip lot of details and case studies,
also I have lot of slides to cover and I actually may not have time to talk about all of them.
So here is a link to The slides as well as more of my articles and other resorces on this toppic.

Now the first one is the most obvious one. Learn how to type with ten
fingure technique. This will enables you to type faster with less errors, use your text
editor shortcuts more efectively and most importantly you will keep your eyes fixed on
the screen all the time, therefore you won't lose focuse of the problem
you are solving

Now the main argument I hear why web-developers and programmers don't
use ten fingers to type is that we type way more special chars, like
brackets, than typists like writers or new editors.

Well yes any layout there is was designed for typists but that's not the
problem of the ten fingure technique that's problem of layouts them
self.

Another problem is that QWERTY keyboard layout  was not designed for speed but so that
that mechanical typewriters won't jam.

In 1914 psychologist and profesor of education August Dvorak and his brother in law designed
keyboard layout that was aimed for less errors during typing. This
layout ended up actually 30% more faster than QWERTY layout.

One funny story is that this speed diference resulted that in 1933
International Commercial Schools Contest QWERTY typists 
complained about Dvorak typists beeing "too loud" from the their speeed.

Now as you can see Dvorak has vowels on the left hand which is the key
to its speed. There are also lot of special chars moved from right small
finger area to the left hand area, which make it more desirable for
programmers to work with.

The biggest argument that I hear against learning Dvorak is that it's
difificult to pair code when everyone else is using QWERTY or that
everyone should just learn English QWERTY layout. But if that so are we
talking about British QWERTY or US QWERTY. For me this is not an
argument in multicurtular city like London. For example here is a photo
of Belgium keyboard that my friend and collegue Anas use.

There are alternative ways how to pair code Like Cloud IDEs that I'll
talk later or ssh to VM.

Let's talk health now. I'm a tall person with wide shoulders and for me
regular keyboards are too small and after 8th hours of using regular
keyboards my wrists hurth.
