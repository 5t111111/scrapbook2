## Kanban

it's lean agile metodology for development practices 

* kan ban (visual card) - visual representation of que that helps (not only) development 
team to visualize the workflow so that software delivery is in sync
* 2 - 4 week sprints of prioritized product backlog (by product owner) estimated 
by by Development team on which end there is deliverable software
* dayly status meeting (daily scrum)
* wip limit - for evry board step has task limit defined on how many task can be there (e.g. in review max = 2).
This limits partialy undone work and substain steady flow of new features (not batch feature delivery).
In other words it's better to have 2 tasks done, than 8 80% done
